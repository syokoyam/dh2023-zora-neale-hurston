When I get in Illinois
I'm going to spread the news about the Florida boys.
Chorus: (All men straining at rail in concert.)
Shove it over! Hey, hey, can't you line it? -a-lack-a-lack.
(Shaking rail.) Ah, shack-a-lack-a-lack-a_lack-a-lack
(Grunt as they move rail.)
Can't you move it?
Hey, hey, can't you try.
